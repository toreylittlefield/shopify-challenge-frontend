## Technologies

React | Next.js + Polaris + TypeScript

- React hooks for state management
- Serverless for API calls
- IndexedBD API for Browser Database and temporary offline storage
- Polaris Components

## Fun Extra Features:

- IndexedDB for persistence storage in the browser to save the users likes. I wanted to pick something more challenging than local/session storage and more scalable.
- Web Share API and Social Media Sharing
- Infinite scrolling to fetch more images
- Animated Loading & Icon
